# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 5, 2017 (fs_poller.py)
**Today's Progress**: Discover pre-defined format video files recursively from specified folder.

### Day 1: December 6, 2017 (Flask)
**Today's Progress**: Had higher expectations for today but got nothing special done...

**Thoughts**: Thought I'd get further and present fs_poller results in some decent manner, but did'nt really get that far off into coding and spent more time debugging, exploring Flask and unit testing a Flask application. Failed today.

### Day 2: December 7, 2017 - ??? 
**Today's Progress**: No real progress. Went to yoga, and favourite bar after work. After getting home, checked out Celery and started tower of hanoi - a codeclub exericise that gives max ammunt of points for one exericise.

**Thougts**: Technical debt is increasing. Need to work extra on weekend to get shit done.

### Day 3: December 8, 2017 - ??? 
**Today's Progress**: An utility that runs command on remote host and spits out its' results as the command is being run. Reads configuration from local ssh conf and therefore can be used over hoppers. Plays audio when done executing. 

**Thougts**: I know I can do it with Ansible, but I needed it for a purpose that ansible is not suited for.

### Day 4: December 9, 2017 - Working Flask API
**Today's Progress**: Working on Flask API and added some off the shelf code for testing my own applications.

**Thougts**: Noting interesting going on here...

### Day 5: December 10, 2017 - Coding music
**Today's Progress**: Wrote code to explore sounds in sonic-pi powered by python-sonic.
**Thougts**: Yesterday I talked about an idea I had once with a friend and he reccommended me an awesome tool called sonic-pi. Although it seems to be written in Ruby, there's a Python interface in pypi called python-sonic. Check it out, it's awesome!
