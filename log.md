# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 5, 2017 (fs_poller.py)
**Today's Progress**: Discover pre-defined format video files recursively from specified folder.

### Day 1: December 6, 2017 (Flask)
**Today's Progress**: Had higher expectations for today but got nothing special done...

**Thoughts**: Thought I'd get further and present fs_poller results in some decent manner, but did'nt really get that far off into coding and spent more time debugging, exploring Flask and unit testing a Flask application. Failed today.

### Day 2: December 6, 2017 - ??? 
**Today's Progress**: No real progress. Went to yoga, and favourite bar after work. After getting home, checked out Celery and started tower of hanoi - a codeclub exericise that gives max ammunt of points for one exericise.

**Thougts**: Technical debt is increasing. Need to work extra on weekend to get shit done.
