# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 5, 2017 (fs_poller.py)
**Today's Progress**: Discover pre-defined format video files recursively from specified folder.

### Day 1: December 6, 2017 (Flask)
**Today's Progress**: Had higher expectations for today but got nothing special done...

**Thoughts**: Thought I'd get further and present fs_poller results in some decent manner, but did'nt really get that far off into coding and spent more time debugging, exploring Flask and unit testing a Flask application. Failed today.

### Day 2: December 7, 2017 - ??? 
**Today's Progress**: No real progress. Went to yoga, and favourite bar after work. After getting home, checked out Celery and started tower of hanoi - a codeclub exericise that gives max ammunt of points for one exericise.

**Thougts**: Technical debt is increasing. Need to work extra on weekend to get shit done.

### Day 3: December 8, 2017 - ??? 
**Today's Progress**: An utility that runs command on remote host and spits out its' results as the command is being run. Reads configuration from local ssh conf and therefore can be used over hoppers. Plays audio when done executing. 

**Thougts**: I know I can do it with Ansible, but I needed it for a purpose that ansible is not suited for.

### Day 4: December 9, 2017 - Working Flask API
**Today's Progress**: Working on Flask API and added some off the shelf code for testing my own applications.

**Thougts**: Noting interesting going on here...

### Day 5: December 10, 2017 - Coding music
**Today's Progress**: Wrote code to explore sounds in sonic-pi powered by python-sonic.

**Thougts**: Yesterday I talked about an idea I had once with a friend and he reccommended me an awesome tool called sonic-pi. Although it seems to be written in Ruby, there's a Python interface in pypi called python-sonic. Check it out, it's awesome!

### Day 6: December 11, 2017 - Flask
**Today's Progress**: Fixed stuff.

**Thougts**: Nothing to see here, move along. Not 100% sure where I'm going with this, but I seem to be moving along just nicely. Speed is another factor...

### Day 7: December 12, 2017 - ???
**Today's Progress**: Working on filtering out unique titles.

**Thougts**: Need to filter out unique media files. Get their imdb code (or any other unique id), and look for more interesting stuff about the unique title - to eventually, present the titles, enriched with metadata, through Flask API. 

### Day 8: December 13, 2017 - Regex magic
**Today's Progress**: REGEX magic - Working on filtering out unique titles - pretty solid work so far (good enough, but not perfect)

**Thougts**: Packaged some code into easily deployable application at work today, unfortunatelly that doesn't count for this challenge. Worked on filtering results to filter unique titles. Unique titles must be searched for additional data: trailer, imdb etc... The data is then passed to Flask API that will display the enriched information.

### Day 9: December 14, 2017 - Thursdays's the hardest
**Today's Progress**: I would if I could, but I don't think I should.

**Thougts**: Seriouslly... Not today.
